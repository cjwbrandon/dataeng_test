# Section 5: Machine Learning
For this section, I've used Decision Tree machine learning methods to train the classification model.

# Summary
Best Model: Gradient Boosted Decision Tree using LightGBM
Accuracy on Train set using Cross Validation: 32.57%
Accuracy on Test set: 32.66%

Results using given parameters: Low buying price
(Maintenance = High Number of doors = 4 Lug Boot Size = Big Safety = High Class Value = Good)
